# Never Before Homes

Welcome to Never Before Homes! Never Before Homes is a mock e-commerce site created for the Grace Shopper project. It offers an exciting, unique and modern home buying experience. Users can browse our extensive inventory and purchase old houses, haunted houses, and eco-friendly dwellings.

# Technologies

The site uses express/sequelize for the backend and react/redux for the frontend. The javascript library faker.js is used to help generate fake data for PostgresSQL. To ensure everything is working as expected, code is tested using the Chai BDD/TDD assertion library.

For Deployment, this site is supported by heroku, GitHub, and Travis-CI for continuous integration.
